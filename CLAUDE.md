# Crypto Trading Bot

> Automated BTC/USD spot trading bot — Kraken API + PyTorch ML model, driven by volume profile features.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Choice |
|-------|--------|
| Language | Python 3.12+ |
| ML Framework | PyTorch |
| Exchange API | Kraken (via ccxt) |
| Data Processing | pandas, numpy |
| Config | python-dotenv for secrets |
| Deployment | Local dev → Linux VPS for 24/7 operation |

## CLI Commands

```bash
python3 -m src.data scrape       # fetch all exchange data + compute VP → CSV
python3 -m src.data validate     # validate existing CSV (gaps, prices, VP normalization)
```

| 1D CNN evals (26 evals, best: 61.5% on 4h) | `experiments/EVAL_CNN.md` |
| **Transformer evals (6 evals, best: 63.3% on 1h, 2+1 tested)** | `experiments/EVAL_TRANSFORMER.md` |
| **TP/SL sweep (11 configs, long+short, FGI vs SMA regime)** | `experiments/EVAL_TPSL_SWEEP.md` |
| **Dual-branch Transformer (VP + Candle, separate attention)** | `experiments/EVAL_DUAL_BRANCH.md` |
| **Model evolution history (living doc)** | `experiments/MODEL_HISTORY.md` |
| **⚠ Audit post-mortem — retracts Eval 11/12/17/18** | `experiments/EVAL_AUDIT.md` |
| **v10: 90-day temporal × 30-day VP (post-audit experiment)** | `architecture_docs/arch-ml-model.md` §v10 |
| **Label redesign — triple-barrier options, v11 post-mortem** | `experiments/LABEL_REDESIGN.md` |
| Run folder → eval mapping | `experiments/RUN_INDEX.md` |

## Key Data

- **Primary feature**: 50-bin relative volume profile (VP) per candle
- **VP structure features**: ceiling/floor distance, peak strength, peak consistency (7 cols)
- **VP bins**: `vp_rel_00` (−25% from price) through `vp_rel_49` (+25% from price), bin 25 = current price
- **Data source**: Bitstamp + Coinbase merged OHLCV, from 2016-01-01
- **Timeframe**: 1h candles (24 bars/day) — switched from 4h for more training data
- **Lookback**: 720 bars (30 days at 1h)
- **Fear & Greed Index**: daily FGI data from 2018-02, used for regime detection (`data/fear_greed_index.csv`)
- **Trading strategy doc**: `experiments/STRATEGY.md` — user's VP support/resistance approach

## Security Rules

- **Never commit `.env`** — API keys live there
- **Kraken API keys**: trade-only permission, no withdraw
- **Never log API keys** — sanitize error output
- See `security_check/SECURITY.md` for full threat model

## Coding Rules

- All times in UTC
- Financial data: use `float` (sufficient for BTC/USD prices at this scale)
- Feature computation in inference must exactly match training pipeline — any divergence silently degrades predictions
- Time-series splits only (never random shuffle) for train/val/test
- Default to not trading when uncertain — the safest action is to do nothing

## Build Status

| Phase | Title | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|
| 1 | Project Setup & Data Pipeline | **Complete** |
| 2 | Feature Engineering | **Complete** |
| 3 | ML Model Development | **Audit complete + 5 post-audit experiments rejected. v11 identified the Phase 3 binding constraint (label formula geometry leak) — project reopens under "experimental playground" framing.** 2026-04-12 audit retracted Eval 11/12/17/18. Honest best (`conf_70 + tp/sl guard + 1x / 20% + 24h pause`) is +6.0% CAGR / -18.4% DD / holdout ≈ -5%. Rejected post-audit: Stage 1 regression, Stage 2 v9 structure token, v10 (30d VP × 90d temporal), both-sides short overlay, v11 absolute-VP @ 15m. The v11 post-mortem exposed that **every Phase 3 label formula shared inputs with VP features**, making the VP hypothesis unfalsifiable. Next: triple-barrier labels + v11-full vs v11-nopv ablation = first falsifiable VP test. See `experiments/LABEL_REDESIGN.md`, `EVAL_AUDIT.md` §9, `MODEL_HISTORY.md` §§26–29. |
